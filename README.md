# Jumia Clone Project Readme

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my Jumia Clone project! This project is a work in progress and is built using Next.js for frontend development, MongoDB for the database, Lucide for icons, and ShadcnUI for the user interface. Inspired by the popular ecommerce platform Jumia, I aim to replicate its functionality and user experience.

Leveraging MongoDB's Atlas vector search feature, I've optimized product search and retrieval for enhanced performance.

The database consists of over 100,000 products from Amazon to populate it. It's been quite the endeavor, but I'm excited about the possibilities it presents!

## Current Focus
My current focus revolves around two main areas:

1. **API Development**: I am actively working on developing the API to handle pagination and filters efficiently. This is crucial for providing a smooth user experience, especially given the vast number of products I've scraped.

2. **Product Category Page**: I'm in the process of implementing the product category page. This will allow users to navigate through different categories of products seamlessly.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Utilized for building server-rendered React applications.
- **MongoDB**: Chosen as the database to store and manage product data, with the added benefit of Atlas vector search for optimized queries.
- **Lucide**: Provides a library of icons to enhance the user interface.
- **ShadcnUI**: Employs UI components to create a visually appealing frontend.
- **Figma**: Utilized for designing the user interface with a focus on responsiveness.
